# Terminology

Throughout this document, terms are used that were defined in the SHACL specification [[SHACL]]. For those SHACL terms that are used often, we restate their definitions in this section. This document is wriiten for readers who are already familiar with RDF [[RDF-concepts]].

SHACL assumes a <dfn>data graph</dfn> ([SHACL: *data graph*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-data-graph)) and a <dfn>shapes graph</dfn> ([SHACL: *shapes graph*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-shapes-graph)). The data graph contains some information and the shapes graph is used to validate that information.

A shapes graph is an RDF graph that contains the definition of one or more <dfn>shapes</dfn> ([SHACL: *shape*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-shape)). Shapes are defined by <dfn>target declarations</dfn> ([SHACL: *target declaration*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-target-declarations)) and <dfn>constraints</dfn> ([SHACL: *constraint*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-constraint)). Target declarations define a set of nodes, the <dfn>target</dfn> ([SHACL: *target*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-target)), in the data graph that must conform to the shapeâ€™s constraints. Each constraint in the shapes graph is defined by its <dfn>kind</dfn> ([SHACL: *kind*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-kind)), i.e., a <dfn>constraint component</dfn> ([SHACL: *constraint component*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-constraint-component)), and by its <dfn>prameters</dfn> ([SHACL: *parameter*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-parameters)). Depending on the kind and parameters of a constraint, nodes will be tested against different conditions, for example: checking whether strings or URIs match a regular expression, checking whether a node  has a minimum cardinality for certain properties, and many more. 

SHACL distinguishes between <dfn>node shape</dfn> ([SHACL: *node shape*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#node-shapes)) and <dfn>property shapes</dfn> ([SHACL: *property shape*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#property-shapes)), the difference being that the former do not have <dfn>property paths</dfn> ([SHACL: *property path*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-shacl-property-path)) and therefore place constraints on nodes, while the latter do have paths. Property shapes place constraints on nodes reachable through paths that match a property path expression. The simplest form of a property path expression is a <dfn>predicate path</dfn> ([SHACL: *predicate path*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-predicate-path)), more complex forms include <dfn>concatenation</dfn> ([SHACL: *concatenation*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-sequence-path)), <dfn>inversion</dfn> ([SHACL: *inversion*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-inverse-path)) and <dfn>transitive closure</dfn> ([SHACL: transitive closure](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-zero-or-more-path)) of [=property paths=].

SHACL distinguishes between [=focus nodes=] and [=value nodes=].
<dfn>Focus nodes</dfn> ([SHACL: *focus node*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-focus-node)) are the nodes that are being validated by a shape.
During validation of a focus node, the concept of [=value nodes=] is used.
The set of <dfn>value nodes</dfn> ([SHACL: *value nodes*](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#dfn-value-nodes)) is defined the nodes reachable from the focus node through a [=property path=] (if the shape is a [=property shape=]) and as the focus node itself if the shape has no property path (i.e., for [=node shapes=]).
