## Introduction {#introduction}

This document interprets SHACL [[SHACL]] as a subgraph extraction language. We call the extracted subgraphs *shape fragments*. Shape fragments are defined using *neighborhoods*. A neighborhood of a node for a shape is the part of a data graph that shows the node conforms to a shape. Neighborhoods are defined differently for different kinds of constraints; in the remainder of this document exact definitions for neighborhoods for each constraint type in SHACL core.
